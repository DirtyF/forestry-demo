All Spanish verbs end in either _-er_, _-ar,_ or _-ir._ Each category of these verbs has specific rules governing how they change to express layers of crucial information about the situation. The category of verbs that ends in _-er_ has the most irregular verbs  (72% are irregular), which means that most of the verbs you encounter will unfortunately not follow the regular conjugation scheme. Luckily, the conjugations for _-er_ verbs are very similar to _-ir_ verbs in the present tense, with only the _vosotros_ and _nosotros_ forms differing â€“ think of it as a two-for-one deal!

All Spanish verbs end in either -*er*, _-ar,_ or _-ir_.
Each -*er*.

\-_er_
