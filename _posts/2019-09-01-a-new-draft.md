## How do I use line breaks?

By default, when you hit ENTER, it will create a new paragraph.

But if you hit SHIFT+ENTER  
Then it means all you want  
Is a line break.

Line breaks are nice  
When your write poems.

Same goes for code blocks:

    This is some clever code.
    I am a new line.
    
    Press ENTER two times to insert a blank line
